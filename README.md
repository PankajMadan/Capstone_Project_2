# Home Credit Loan Project
#### Home Credit, a global lending platform, strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data, including telecom and transactional information, to predict their clients' repayment abilities. Thus given a set of client specific features, the aim of this ML project is to ascertain whether a given customer (if approved) would default (class 1) on the home loan or not (class 0).
