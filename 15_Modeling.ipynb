This model  performed  worse than the tuned Logistic Regression Model on the test set. This was expected as the underlying feature space is not multivariate normal and doesn't have the same covariance matrix for both the classes ,which are the underlying assumption of the LDA models. Further the R_R ratio of the tuned Logistic Regression model was greater that of the LDA classifier using LW lemma Shrinkage.\n",
